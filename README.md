## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Phung Le (she/her) and I'm currently a Master of Engineering student studying bioengineering and bioinformatics and UC Berkeley. 

In addition to taking technical courses in computational biology and functional genomics, I'm also working on a capstone project called "machine learning for medical image analysis and modeling" with teammates from different departments. Coming from a background in biology (my undergraduate major), I look forward to delving deeper into computational biology!

In my free time, I like to play badminton, work on English <> Vietnamese literary translation projects, and hang out with my family and friends.
